A simple real chatting project.

First of all you need to install node modules by running 'npm install', 'cd client && npm install' and 'cd server && npm install'.
Then you need to run 'npm start' to run the frontend and backend concurrently.

You can change the database url in .env file to fit to you.

Hope you have a nice time with this!!
